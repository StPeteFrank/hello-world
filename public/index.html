    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I started my career as a restaurant manager. 
      I went on to master this field as I became a general manager and later a multi-unit area manager. 
      This was a perfectly viable way of life until I decided to become an adult and try to start a family.
      The hours didn't allow me the quality of life needed to be a family person.

    </p>
    <p>The goal for me is to leave the wonderfully tiresome world of hospitality behind and become a <em>normal person</em> if you will.</p>
  <p>  
<h3>How I plan on achieving my goal</h3>
  <li>Attending all classes asking every question that comes to  mind.</li>
  <li>Completing all homework assignments.</li>
  <li>Learning how to submit all my assignments.</li>
  <li>Focusing on newly learned areas until it all comes together.</li>
  <li>Building a network of developers in my area.</li>
  <li>Following the instructions of my peers and instructors.</li>
  </p>
  <h2>How it's going</h2>
 <p>I'm becoming more comfortable with using HTML and the beginner appropriate tags.
   As far as submitting my work and navigating Github I could use more instruction and application practice.
